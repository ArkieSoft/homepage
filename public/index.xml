      <description>So I was given a link to the &amp;ldquo;Cyrillish&amp;rdquo; script, and I found the concept interesting. Any anglophone and specifically English Second Language (ESL) speakers will say that the english writing system is incoherent. Exceptions, galore. Inconsistencies everywhere. So much so that people throughout history have made attempts at writing new writing systems for English that gel with modern day useage. Among these include going back to the old English Anglo-Saxon runes adapted from Elder Futharc, the Shavian Alphabet, or Benjamin Franklin&amp;rsquo;s Phonetic Alphabet.</description>

      <description>Cosmic Alpha 2 is out and it is downright an improvement beyond my expectations. Having tried Alpha 1, I had an idea of what to expect, but out of the problems I have noticed, most have been fixed. I will lay out the issues I found with Alpha 1, and what has changed.&#xA;I have it installed on NixOS under the 24.05 branch. I am using Lily Foster&amp;rsquo;s module to install it.</description>

Make sure to look out for to look at my nixos builds for my machines.&#xA;I am not nearly as involved as I should be on that, maybe follow me to encourage more posts out of me.&#xA;Yes, it is ok to deadname Twitter.
