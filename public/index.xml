      <description>Cosmic Alpha 2 is out and it is downright an improvement beyond my expectations. Having tried Alpha 1, I had an idea of what to expect, but out of the problems I have noticed, most have been fixed. I will lay out the issues I found with Alpha 1, and what has changed.&#xA;I have it installed on NixOS under the 24.05 branch. I am using Lily Foster&amp;rsquo;s module to install it.</description>

      <description>My github page is mostly just me working on nix configs and any autistic hyperfocus at any given time. Make sure to look out for to look at my nixos builds for my machines.&#xA;I am not nearly as involved as I should be on that, maybe follow me to encourage more posts out of me.&#xA;Yes, it is ok to deadname Twitter. I am on here at times, where I shitpost occassionally.</description>
