## [![Github](https;//github.com/ArkieSoft)](https://github.com/ArkieSoft)


My github page is mostly just me working on nix configs and any autistic hyperfocus at any given time. Make sure to look out for [![nixos]()](https://github.com/ArkieSoft/nixos) to look at my nixos builds for my machines.

## [![Mastodon]()](https://kolektiva.social/@arkannon)
I am not nearly as involved as I should be on that, maybe follow me to encourage more posts out of me.

## [![Twitter]()](https://x.com/arkiearkannon)

Yes, it is ok to deadname Twitter. I am on here at times, where I shitpost occassionally.

## [![Mail]()](mailto:arkannon@arkannon.com) 

Feel free to send me an email for any questions, or just getting a hold of me.

## Discord

I moderate for an quickly growing Linux-centered discord server. If at all interested, **please** head over (https://discord.gg/linux)
